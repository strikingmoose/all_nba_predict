    "In our last post, we harnessed the power of PCA even futher to look at different ways to break up the PCA bi-plot. With ggbiplot's \"ellipse\" argument, we were able to check out where different players lie on the plot. To review, my 3 main questions were:\n",
    "- How closely can I map different \"types\" of players to sections of the plot?\n",
    "- How can I account for players who exhibit qualities across multiple \"types\" of players?\n",
    "- What does that bottom-right hand side of the plot communicate exactly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these questions may answer the others, but I'd say all 3 are worth consideration and I'd hope to answer by the end of this post."

However, basketball is more complex than that and I guess humans have the ability to score AND rebound. Man who woulda thunk it. In fact, rebounding can even LEAD TO scoring! No way!! We kinda saw this with the placement of Shaq's data points on the last post right?\n",

You see a lot of 2-way players here like Tony Allen, Shawn Marion, Sheed, Tayshaun, Thaddeus, Wilson Chandler who could, but never consistently lit up the scoreboard but seemingly were still efficient in their play and managed to gather **20 / 9 / 4 on AST / REB / AST** per 100 possessions.

Sure, AST / STL / 3PA might be correlated, but there isn't necessarily causation here from one to the other, but rather the human who is playing the game has the physical attributes, and has the coaching staff that put him in a situation where he is able to succeed in getting these types of numbers.

PCA isn't defining specific roles, or perhaps even natural correlation actually, but it is painting a story of how the game has been historically played (without necessarily any information on how the game will evolve in the future). Historically, there are stronger correlations between certain factors, and whether it's due to some sort of natural cause or causation through coaching... etc, these relationships do exist statistically and it's quite interesting to walk this fine line between watching a basketball game unfolding and seeing the same story being told from a numbers perspective."
