    "# 30 - Classifying All-NBA Players (Reviewing Trees for Feature Selection)\n",
    "I'm pretty happy with our models and predictions. I can say that while I was making those 10 posts about those 10 different models, I really started to question my objectives, and life in general and why I was even doing what I was doing. I was so far removed from any tangible predictions and was just caught up in AUC, and sensitivity / specificity metrics. Never once did I actually try to predict it on a test data set until the last post. Again, _**super happy**_ to see that the results were on the right track.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout that whole journey, though, I had one thing (among others) in the back of my mind: Feature selection. Even though the model is performing relatively well, I couldn't help but think that we were using only two features. At the end of the day, I basically hand-picked these two because I knew they were all-encapsuling metrics. Since WS and VORP are based upon your overall \"contribution\" to the team, they take into account PTS, REB, AST... etc intrinsically. This is nice and all, but we are really just guessing that WS and VORP have the most to do with all-NBA status... We didn't even try to quantify any other metric. Since we're trying to find _**the best model**_, I can't tell you for sure that PTS isn't an important factor because I never really tried to find out! I just went with my intuition. Even now, I'm pretty happy with the model in general, but I can't say that it can't be better because I started with 2 features and stuck with my guns the whole time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we extend our scope of finding the best model, I think any activities with some rhyme or reason will be able to be modeled in the future state of our world. Even if we take a really simple act like whether or not someone will pass the ball, you could probably theoretically generate a model with super detailed features like where their eyes are looking, the angle of their elbows at the time, the way they are holding the ball, the placement of their defender, the placement of the defender on their teammate they are passing to... etc we could go on forever right? If you could get down to like a millimeter measurement of every aspect of everything on the floor ever, you could probably predict what anyone will do at any given time. So back to my WS and VORP example, I _**know**_ the model can be better for sure, but it's just a matter of finding which features matter the most, and in this data set specifically, we don't quite have too in-depth measurements. Having said that, though, bball-ref still has one of the richest datasets out there, and there is still a lot to parse through for someone like me who is just getting acquainted with many of these metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "At one point in the beginning, I found myself thinking \"man, there are a ton of metrics here... I'd better do my research to get some context on what each of these mean and whether they intuitively sway an all-NBA vote or not\". That's why I took a deeper dive into WS and VORP right? Because I wanted to understand what the hell was actually going on there. Going through the trees chapter in ESL and using the tree-based methods (single decision trees, random forests, gradient boosted trees), it's clear that, if I have a regression or classification objective, a tree-based method would actually be able to shoulder some of this feature selection responsibility for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection is an interesting thing. Many models can actually do it, and even logistic regression intrinsically is performing feature selection because we're assigning a coefficient that's literally saying \"hey, this is the quantitative amoung in which this feature affects the log-odds of the output being this class\". We saw the effects of multicollinearity in post \\#22 about logistic regression, so have to go through an extra step of calculating the VIF if we want our model to work properly (which goes hand in hand with feature selection). Trees on the other hand, don't have this problem, and in fact if we look back to post \\#23, we list a bunch of advantages that trees have over pretty much every other model:\n",
    "- Fast to construct\n",
    "- Interpretable models (if trees are relatively small)\n",
    "- Can naturally incorporate numeric and categorical featuers\n",
    "- Immune to outliers\n",
    "- _**Perform internal feature selection**_\n",
    "\n",
    "And from what we saw before, it seemed pretty cool that we could just output feature importances and that this was an _**intrinsic characteristic**_ of ensemble learning, where we can be more confident that the results were constructed from a methodology that exerts low variance characteristics as well. It's also immune to outliers and multicollinearity because there's no statstical regression when choosing when to make the splits, it's simply calculating _**the best possible split, period.**_ If two features are highly correlated, one of them will still yield a better split, and that one will get chosen. Theoretically, we could just throw all the original features into something like a random forest, or even a single tree, and be able to get an idea of which features matter the most for our objective (in this case, classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "I need to stop and review because, _**first of all**_, I am _**by no means**_ saying that we don't have to do our homework up front. I'm not saying throw all your variables into a random forest, get the top 2 or 3 features, and call it a day. I'm saying what a nice and useful exploratory tool you have at your dispoasal for preliminary exploratory analysis! If a tree continuously decides to split on WS and VORP, then clearly there is something there for us to explore. It won't answer the question \"what makes a player all-NBA status?\" but it will bring up the question \"why do WS and VORP contribute so much to all-NBA production?\" which will provide a stepping stone to the the ultimate objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, enough talking about it. Let's try it! I'll put in a few more features and throw them into a decision tree, random forest, and GBM to see what the feature importance plots give us."
