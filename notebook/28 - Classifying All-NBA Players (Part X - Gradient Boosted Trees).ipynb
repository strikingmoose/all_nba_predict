    "Jesus christ... we are on our 10th classifier... I'm going to have to make this my last one because I feel like I'm not doing any analysis anymore haha. NOT THAT THIS ISN'T FUN... but I'd like to actually be able to compare some of these methods together to get a better sense of how they function compared to each other. I'm basically just playing with very very shiny things right now.\n",

    "The two photos are pretty much mirror images of each other, right? Well trees make up the base of the classifier we are about to use, but first, we have to explore _**gradient boosting**_. Gradient boosting is essentially an ensemble method that averages a bunch of trees together. Wait, didn't we already do this in bagging and random forests in post \\#24? The answer is yes because all 3 are ensemble methods using the basic decision tree as its base learner, however, gradient boosting is a beast that works in a very different fashion. I'm not going to pretend like I've been there since the beginning of gradient boosting or machine learning in general, but the buzz is that gradient boosting, and the _**xgboost**_ library in particular that we're going to use today, is sitting pretty right now with gradient boosting becoming one of the biggest breakthrough concepts in the last decade and xgboost owning all the kaggle competitions right now. It seems that, along with deep learning neural nets, gradient boosting is basically magical.\n",

    "Ok, let's get into gradient boosting. The main explanation I hear about gradient boosting, including how they introduce it in [ESL](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/download.html), is that _**boosting**_ builds a _**committee**_ of learners by combining multiple _**weak learners**_. In general, the ensemble approach is analagous to the \"ask the audience\" option in who wants to be a millionaire. How many times have you seen the audience get a question wrong and the phone a friend guy get the answer wrong? The audience (albeit that lifeline is often used in the earlier stages of the game) is almost never wrong! Boosting takes this one step even further by making each of these learners an expert in one section of the data. It's like you can phone 100 friends, each of them being an expert at something. In fact, boosting is even crazier than that, after we've seen the question, we can then, in hindsight, _**pick a specific friend**_ who knows about the subject matter and increase our chances dramatically that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before fully understanding boosting from ESL, I first stumbled upon this video by Alexander Ihler @ UC Irvine who does a beautiful job just visiualizing the steps of boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start out with a data set and we fit a very simple model. Here, our step function can essentially be seen like a 1 node tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/2017edmfasatb/fas_boto/images/boosting/1boostingsteps.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "On the left hand side, we see our raw data. Here, we only have 1 feature (x axis) and an output (y axis). We \"fit\" the regression tree\n",
    "- if $x<0.9$ then $y\\approx -48$\n",
    "- if $x>=0.9$ then $y\\approx 5$\n",
    "\n",
    "On the right hand side, we see the residuals of our first tree against our data. This is where our second learner comes in. In classic boosting, We then fit _**another**_ regression tree to the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/2017edmfasatb/fas_boto/images/boosting/2boostingsteps.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model then becomes our original tree plus some weighted version of our second tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/2017edmfasatb/fas_boto/images/boosting/3boostingsteps.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we do with this new model? That's right, we fit another tree to its residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/2017edmfasatb/fas_boto/images/boosting/4boostingsteps.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "What really ends up happening at the end of the day is that we'll start to build a model that gets closer and closer to the actual shape of the data. Like a neural network of sorts, we're essentially able to use something simple like a tree (depicted by a step function here) and sum more and more of them to build the model or decision boundary. If we took infinite trees, just ilke if we took infinite step functions or sigmoids, we can essentially build any function we want. Along with the neural network, boosting loses a bit of its interpretability because at the end of the day its like hundreds or thousands of trees, and good luck understanding the placement of each, but we'd see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/2017edmfasatb/fas_boto/images/boosting/5boostingsteps.png\" style=\"width: 700px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We see above that our residuals are shrinking more and more because all we've done here is take the latest model, _**find what its weaknesses are**_, and fit a model _**specifically geared towards fixing this weakness**_. In a sense, the newest tree at every iteration is _**trained to be an expert at everything the old model missed**_. Often, single node trees are used for the weak learners, so it takes a few iterations for the trees to start becoming experts at very specific portions of the data or even specific observations themselves, but in general the newest tree is picking up some of the slack of the sum of the previous trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Gradient**_ boosting is an extension of classic boosting where, instead of fitting the residuals, we define a _**loss function**_, as we always do, descend through the gradient to the hells of uninterpretable statistical accuracy. Amazing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of classification, there are a few loss functions that are usually used:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/2017edmfasatb/fas_boto/images/boosting/6classificationloss.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This plot is straight out of ESL and does a great job of visualizing how our misclassifications are being penalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of misclassification loss, our rule is simple: We penalize a constant amount for wrong classifications, we don't penalize at all for correct classifications. We can see situations where this may not be ideal when our margin _**grossly**_ misclassifies by euclidean distance and we actually want to penalize far away misclassifications more severely than others. A $yf$ value of less than 0 is a misclassification, by the way, and above 0 is a correct classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at squared error loss, we see that we'd actually be penalizing _**correct**_ classifications! This means that points _**well within**_ the correct side of the decision boundary will get penalized _**the more correct they are**_!\n",
    "\n",
    "We then get into some of the more common misclassification loss functions, take deviance, where we don't penalize grossly wrong classifications as much (more robust to outliers) and we also penalize observations less and less the more correct they become.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to xgboost. This is a gradient boosted trees algorithm that... well... I need to learn more about lol."

    "Nice, that only took like 5 seconds! Funny enough though, the best iteration here is actually the 26th iteration and we've gotten up to 0.979. What If I keep my early stop mechanism and I decrease my step size? Also, just looking at the data a bit, I'm not 100% sure if an early stop threshold of 10 continuously decreasing iterations are enough... I'm seeing decreases of 8 and then the model jumps to another maximum AUC... that's not too far off from 10 and I wonder if I'm cutting off the iterations prematurely in some of these iterations. I'll try and early stop threshold of 20 iterations."

The unfortunate thing right now is that I think I'm getting super super caught up in a kaggle-crazed accuracy prediction mode. All I'm caring about, and all I'm getting excited over is that one AUC number. It's like cocaine to me right now. I need more AUC, all of the AUC in fact. The downside to thid mindset is... well... this frickin model is an aggregate of, on this last model, over 100 trees. How the hell am I supposed to explain this to someone else?\n",

    "If I've learned anything in consulting so far, it's that _**some**_ people just do not have the time of day. Through no fault of their own, they simply won't get the message unless it's simple and relatable to them. So when I've gone through and tuned not even like 1/3 of the parameters that I should have probably played around with to really get a feel for the model, how can I expect someone else to pick it up in one conversation? Contrast this to the decision tree which literally gave me a picture of a frickin tree that I can put into a slide or something and had an AUC of 0.971 anyways, it's pretty easy to say which model I'd go with _**in the business world**_. In the data science / Kaggle world, of course I'd pick the boosted tree. A higher accuracy is objective... it's simply the best I've seen, and that works for me because interpretability is not an issue I have to worry about. The flip side is me banging my head on a desk 80 times because I lost a battle with an executive who would rather do 1000 other tasks of higher priority than listening to me sit here and justify the 0.09 AUC difference (again, what's AUC again?), so if I can save that and take the 0.09 AUC hit, I'll probably do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing I've noticed about boosted trees is that the results are slightly different every time! The aggregate trees will change because, like random forest, _**each iteration takes only a subset of the data and only a subset of the columns**_ to average a variety of models together and decrease variance.\n",

Won't quite go into too much analysis as to why they're different (because I don't know the mechanisms of each model by heart yet), but something I'll definitely keep in the back of my mind! Let's just check the ROC from the ROCR package because I want to see the sensitivity and specificity values of the best value."

    "95% / 92%. Definitely the best we've seen so far considering both, as noted by the AUC. Also, note now the AUC on the training data is actually 0.9811 now on the ROC plot. This is because I had to use xgboost instead of xgb.cv in order to get the feature importances and predictions. 0.9811 was higher than what we saw before (0.98) because we were looking at the AUC metrics for the _**test set**_ earlier. As we get further, gradient boosting can basically fit our data 100% (unless there's an overlap of a data point) because, with more iterations, we fit trees specifically geared for certain observations or even single observations, so we'll always be able to pick out all the spatial intricacies. This value of _**nrounds**_ is what cross validation chose for us, so we'll go ahead with this model. Even though the model is probabyl slightly overfitting a bit, it's actually quite interesting to see how flexible the GBM is compared to other models. With certain models, it would be basically _**impossible**_ to achieve this AUC even on the training data becauese the models and the boundaries they produce are way too rigid. Cool stuff.\n",
